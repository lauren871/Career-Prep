    ### Using APIs, Flask, & Django
    1. __APIs__: Often create RESTful APIs using Flask or Django REST framework. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other. A Python developer might create an API to fetch data from a database and serve it to a front-end application.
    2. __Flask__: A micro-framework that is lightweight and eas to  use for small to medium-sized web applications. It provides the essentials to get an app up and running quickly
    3. __Django__: A high-level framework that includes many built-in features, making it suitable for larger applications. It provides toolds for database management, authentication, and more.
